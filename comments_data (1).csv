I am wondering do you have a video to show a simple scenario, when we create a pivot table, we want to attach additional columns of info from our original data sheet as companion info without making those data as computational (as we don&#39;t need it) or it will just expand into so many columns that is not useful. Appreciate your kind advice as run into such common needs very often. Now i need to use V/Xlookup to map the data column manually to maintain my overall readability of my pivoted details. Thanks~!"
